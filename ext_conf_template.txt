  # cat=basic; type=string; label=Delete duplicates : Deletes duplicates (e.g. user is subscribed via tt_address but creates now a fe_user account via sr_feuserregister). In fact deletes all tt_address entries with same email then fe_user when editing/creating a fe-user manually in backend. If sr_feuserregister is used it will hook into this extension and after creation / confirmation of the account it will check for tt_address records with the same email and in case delete them. Set here the pid where the ext should search for "duplicate" tt_address records. Special value "ALL" means search on every page. If you leave this field empty no "duplicates" check will be done. It is recommended to set this value to the same value than "newRecordStoragePid" and "storagePid" (extbase TS).
deleteDuplicateAddressPid= 

  # cat=basic; type=boolean; label=PID check for tt_address records : If set then only tt_address records with respective PID (set via normal extbase config - "newRecordStoragePid" and "storagePid" or use "Starting point" field ...) will be taken in to consideration. You should check this if you have any other extension installed which make use of tt_address records (e.g. tx_commerce). On the other hand if you disable this check you can spread tt_address records all over your page and sort them like you want. It is recommended to check this field.
checkForPid=true
